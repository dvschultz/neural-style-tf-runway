files:
    # All files in the root project directory will be copied to the Docker image
    # automatically. Builds that require excessive storage can fail or take a
    # very long time to install on another user's machine. You can use the

# The build_steps array allows you to run shell commands at build time. Each
# Each build step is executed in the order it appears in the array.
